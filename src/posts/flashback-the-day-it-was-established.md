The *Drug War* didn't start with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). Neither did problems surrounding the enforcement of drug laws. In fact many of these problems have persisted for decades, regardless of the agency in charge. So much so that when reading press reports from decades ago they sound as if written just yesterday. To set the scene for the next couple months I'd like to start with one such press report published right when the DEA began.

![DEA Genealogy ](/images/22-17-53-jul-07-2020.png "DEA Genealogy")

The United States has been attempting to enforce drug laws since the early 1900s. Throughout that period various agencies have been in charge of this mission. The establishment of the DEA consolidated many agencies. The main two being **Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs** (BNDD) and **Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement** (ODALE). The B.N.D.D. established only a few years prior in 1968 from a similar consolidation of agencies.

As previously mentioned these agencies all suffered their fair share of problems. Recently the new tactic of a "no-knock" warrant had been deployed across the country. With many Americans surprised such a thing would even take place in America. Along with "preventative detention", the "no-knock" tactic was first incorporated into a Washington D.C. crime bill before being rolled out nation-wide.

An [article](https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/01/archives/the-nation-drug-raids.html) from *The New York Times* published on July 1st, 1973 begins by offering some imagery.

> "Doors crumbling under the weight of policemen. Unkempt officers, some fresh from   stops at local bars, ransacking homes, breaking furniture and shouting obscenities while holding terrified families at gunpoint."

Germany in the 1930s they ask.

> "No, the United States in the 1970's as 'the Narks,' the street term for Federal, state and local narcotics agents, go about their routine business of fighting what President Nixon has called 'the most despicable crime' —drug dealing."

After a two month investigation by the newspaper they concluded that the *Narks* "have mistakenly broken into the homes and apartments of dozens of innocent families, terrorizing the occupants and heavily damaging property."

It's remarkable and I should be much less surprised than I am by articles like this. What is also important to note about this effort is that it didn't work! Remember this is before the 80s, cocaine was prevalent but not close to what it was about to be. Much of this wasn't to go after organized crime, it was to prevent John Doe from flushing his drugs down the toilet. Before taking office and while in office Nixon maintained his tough on crime stance, focusing on drug addiction. Going as far as citing questionable studies linking crime to drug addiction. Studies carried out by partisans looking to get noticed inside the beltway.

Detailed throughout the article are chaotic raids with little organization. Many even resulting in no drugs whatsoever. One of the more *famous* raids happened in Collinsville, Illinois. Taking place on the night of April 23, 1973, fifteen gun-carrying agents burst into a home and rushed upstairs. That home belonged to Herbert Joseph Giglotto, he later recalled, 

> "I got out of bed; I took about three steps, looked down the hall and I \[saw] men running up the hall dressed like hippies with pistols, yelling and screeching. I turned to my wife. 'God, honey, we're dead'"

Quick to grab him, handcuff and throw him onto the bed. One of the men pointing to his wife saying **"Who is that bitch lying there?"** He pleaded with them responding "Before you shoot her, before you do anything, check my identification, because I know you're in the wrong place." After more manhandling and the classic "If you don't tell us where the drugs are, we will kill you." The leader of the pack broke the news, "We made a mistake." *The New York Times* writing, "They had no warrants, no permission from their superiors and took no photographs of damage as their regulations require. They found no drugs."

Earlier in the year on Jan. 26, local police kicked down the door of Mrs. Anna Majette's apartment. One raider bragging, "We've heard a lot about this house." Only to found out they'd made a mistake. Mrs. Majette pointed out that she resided in Apartment J and the warrant was for Apartment A.

Going further back we find an incident that took place on Sept. 20 in New York. Four state troopers rushed into the home of James R. Herman holding his family at gun point, while they ransacked the house searching for drugs. Only to conclude as the *The New York Times* wrote that "it seems the Hermans’ address did not match a phone number which police had overheard on a wiretap." One state trooper describing it as **"one hell of a raid"** and that the error was an "insignificant detail."

These raids would have fatal consequences. On April 24, 1972 agents with B.N.D.D. and their local counterparts moved to conduct an operation on a mountain cabin. Their goal being to seize a "giant \[drug] lab." Rushing in without announcing their intentions the owner of the cabin Mr. Dirk Dickenson fled into the woods. Only to get shot in the back by Lloyd Clifton, a B.N.D.D. agent. Bureau regulations forbid shooting at fleeing suspects and Clifton found himself indicted by a county grand jury. The charges [dropped](https://www.nytimes.com/1975/02/04/archives/suit-impugns-integrity-of-judge-on-freeing-drug-agent-in-death.html) in Sept by a judge for lack of evidence.

For those of us living in 2020 hearing stories like this might not all be surprising since such incidents continue to happen. But this surprised some folks, one women telling *The New York Times*,

> “The frightening thing about these raids,” said a woman who survived one, “is that they can happen to anyone. You, me or our children.”

 Another saying, "I didn't know police operated like that in America."

To get a feeling of how the agents conducting these raids felt one noted,

> “it's hard to keep the uplifting goals of society in mind when you're ‘working with these vermin.”

In hindsight none of this should be surprising. Nixon was in full force focused on drug arrests, seizures and getting rid of street crime that he proposed happened by a majority at the hands of addicts. Folks in his inner circle making haphazard attempts to influence public opinion. Such as trying to correlate annual heroin ingestion plus the price of heroin to annual dollar amount of stolen property.  Also important to note is the ballooning of local narcotics enforcement expenditures around this time. Noted as being $20.2 million in 1969 to a whopping **$244.2 million** when the article went to press. 

The *New York Times* adding,

> "youthful agents, some recently out of college with no law enforcement experience, are sent into the field where they often execute raids based on uncorroborated tips, often from drug addicts pressured for information." 

The point here is to simply show that drug enforcement has been ineffective and chaotic since the get-go. *The New York Times* article published on the exact day the DEA consolidation became effective. The "no-knock" was only [banned](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/us/breonna-taylor-law-passed.html) in Kentucky last month. And only after another fatal raid, one sounding familiar to those detailed above. Though that doesn't mean all localities around the country have followed suit. Many "no-knock" warrant provisions still exist.

The archived Times article ends with a quote from Senator Charles H. Percy of Illinois.

> "We must be careful that in our zeal against drugs, we do not destroy the society we seek to save.”

We need to all be mindful of this when thinking about the right approach to reduce illicit drug consumption in society.
