Hello. My name is Christopher. I mostly hang out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/just_some_d00d) and run a website called [narco.news](https://narco.news) that aggregates information and press articles related to drug trafficking. My reasons for developing that site are partly the same as this one. I had a need for a central place to aggregate all the information related to drug trafficking. For a while Twitter has served this purpose for me. But my curiosity has reached a point where I want more flexibility and organization of the information I've curated. A place devoted to matters relating to the Drug Enforcement Administration(DEA).

The DEA has only been around since 1973. President Richard Nixon on July 28th 1973 signed Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1973. The plan was then passed over to Congress who accepted it, finalizing the creation of the DEA was we know it today. That isn't to say that drug laws weren't enforced before then. Three agencies merged to form the DEA, the Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs (BNDD), the Office of Drug Abuse Law Enforcement (ODALE), and the Office of National Narcotics Intelligence (ONNI). Including a large group from Customs, altogether forming a force 2,000 agents strong.
